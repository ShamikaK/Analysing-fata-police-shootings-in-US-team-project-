# Analysing-fatal-police-shootings-in-US-team-project-

**Project Goal:** 

Examining the various factors that are related to police shootings in the US

**Goal Description:** 

Our goal is:
 - To analyse and visualise relationships between the independent variables (like gender, location, arms age etc.) and the shooting incident. We can also explore incidents at different granularities like city or state or the arm used.
 - To identify correlation between independent variables (if any).
 - To try and predict (using ML if possible) some dependent variables in the dataset based on the independent variables.
 - To try and combine with other datasets to draw deeper conclusions, for e.g. Population dataset (new addition)
 - Dataset Source: Data Police shootings (https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/data-police-shootings)
